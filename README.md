# WhatsApp-Direct

The app lets you message users (registered on WhatsApp) without saving the numbers to the phone.
Just enter the receivers's phone number and click on "Redirect" to reach the chat field on WhatsApp with an empty message, or type-in the message in "Type Message" field and send the message.
